Cnippet UI is a growing collection of reusable, production‑ready building blocks for modern React/Next.js apps.

- **Components**: Accessible UI primitives and patterns built with Radix and Tailwind.
- **Motion**: Delightful interaction patterns powered by `motion` (Framer Motion v12).
- **Charts**: Examples built with `recharts`.

Use them by copying code directly into your project or by cloning the repository to explore, tweak, and reuse.
