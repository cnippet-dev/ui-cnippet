title: Roadmap
description: Where cnippet is today and where we're headed next.
---

**cnippet** brings components, blocks, implementation guides, and learning resources together so teams can move from idea to production quickly. Here's how each surface is evolving.

## Current Status

- **ui.cnippet.dev** (alpha live, beta in progress) — 40+ core primitives, growing motion components (text effects, marquee, scroll progress, carousel), and early chart components (area, bar, line). Built on Base UI with Tailwind v4 tokens.
- **blocks.cnippet.dev** (planning / early development) — Sections, full pages, and complete templates that reuse cnippet ui primitives for consistency.
- **next.cnippet.dev** (planning / content development) — Production-tested integration guides for auth, payments, DevOps, and more.
- **learn.cnippet.dev** (content development) — Structured courses with roadmaps, projects, and assessments.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1–3)

Complete the component library and establish ecosystem infrastructure.

- Audit all core components for WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- Add comprehensive TypeScript types and documentation
- Build motion components: ScrollReveal, MagneticButton, TypewriterText, and more
- Set up Turborepo monorepo with shared configs
- Configure authentication (Better-Auth) and payment systems (Razorpay, Stripe)
- Publish `@cnippet/ui` v1.0 and `@cnippet/motion` v0.1-beta to npm

## Phase 2: Blocks & Content (Months 3–6)

Build the blocks library and begin content creation.

- Design and build sections: Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, Team, CTA, FAQ, Footer (multiple variants each)
- Assemble complete pages: Landing, About, Contact, Blog, Authentication
- Write first integration guides: Better-Auth, Biome, Razorpay, Prisma ORM
- Create companion GitHub repositories for each guide
- Implement freemium payment flow

## Phase 3: Templates & Learning (Months 6–9)

Complete templates, launch the learning platform, and close the ecosystem loop.

- Build templates: SaaS Starter, Agency Portfolio, Personal Portfolio
- Create template CLI: `npx create-cnippet-app`
- Launch learn.cnippet.dev with React, Next.js, and Prisma learning paths
- Implement capstone project system using cnippet tools
- Expand to 12+ integration guides on next.cnippet.dev

## Phase 4: Growth & Polish (Months 9–12)

Scale content, optimize conversion, and build community.

- Launch Discord community and contributor program
- Add search across all products
- Build unified dashboard for purchases, bookmarks, and progress
- Expand to 20+ guides and 5+ templates
- Begin video content for premium learning paths
- Target: 1,000+ GitHub stars, 500+ Discord members

## Phase 5: Expansion (Months 12–18)

Long-term sustainability and advanced features.

- AI-powered component customizer
- Visual page builder for blocks (drag-and-drop)
- Theme marketplace for community-shared themes
- VS Code extension for quick component insertion
- Team workspaces and enterprise features
- Explore React Native component library (`@cnippet/native`)

## What's Next

- **More primitives:** Close gaps across forms, navigation, data display, and overlays.
- **Motion + charts beta:** Expand the motion catalog and ship chart presets with theme-aware defaults.
- **Blocks & templates:** Broaden sections and templates, keeping parity with component updates.
- **Guides library:** Deep-dives for auth, payments, file storage, email, and real-time patterns.
- **Atoms:** API-enhanced components that bundle UI with integrations for drop-in usage.
