description: Current state of cnippet ui and where we’re headed next..
---

**cnippet** brings components, blocks, and implementation guides together so teams can move from idea to production quickly. Here's how each surface is evolving.

## Current Status

- **ui.cnippet.site (alpha is live, beta in progress):** 40+ core primitives, growing motion components (text effects, marquee, scroll progress, carousel), and early chart components (area, bar, line). Built on Base UI with Tailwind V4 tokens.
- **block.cnippet.site (live):** Sections (hero, features, team, pricing), full pages (landing, about, contact), and complete templates that reuse the same cnippet ui primitives for consistency.
- **next.cnippet.site (alpha in progress):** Practical guides for production tasks—authentication, payment gateways, deployment, observability, and more.

## What’s Next

- **More primitives:** Close gaps across forms, navigation, data display, and overlays.
- **Motion + charts beta:** Expand motion catalog and ship opinionated chart presets with theme-aware defaults.
- **Blocks & templates:** Broaden sections and full templates; keep parity with component updates.
- **Guides library:** Publish deep-dives for auth (NextAuth, custom providers), payments (Stripe and others), file storage, email, and real-time patterns.
- **Atoms:** API-enhanced components that bundle UI with integrations (auth flows, checkout, scheduling) for drop-in usage.
