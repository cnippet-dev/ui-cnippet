This guide covers the essentials for adding **cnippet ui** components to your React application.

## Prerequisites

Our components are built with [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com). Make sure you have a React project set up with Tailwind CSS before you begin.

## Adding Components

You can add components **automatically with the CLI** or **manually by copying the files**. Both methods work for primitives, particles, and atoms.

### With the CLI

Each component page provides a command to add it to your project automatically. The CLI creates the necessary files and installs any dependencies for you.

### Install all UI Components

You can install all **cnippet ui** primitives at once:

```bash
npx cnippet@latest add ui
```

This adds all UI components to your project in one go — button, card, avatar, dialog, tabs, and more.

**Recommended**: Install with our optimized color tokens for the best visual results:

```bash
npx cnippet@latest add ui @cnippet/colors-zinc
```

This installs both the UI components and our default zinc-based color system, which provides crisp, contrasted borders and enhanced visual depth. See the [Styling](/ui/docs/styling) guide for details about our color system.

### Manually

1. **Find a component** on the [Components](/ui/docs) or [Particles](/ui/particles) pages.
2. **Copy the code** from the **Code** tab.
3. **Create a new file** in your project (e.g., `components/ui/button.tsx`) and paste the code.
4. **Install any dependencies** listed on the component's page.
5. **Import and use** the component in your app.

## Styling

Components are styled with a design token system defined by CSS variables and implemented with Tailwind CSS. The variables are the same as shadcn/ui, and fully customizable in your global stylesheet (e.g., `app/globals.css`).

We've introduced a few additional tokens for more granular control:

- `--destructive-foreground`: Used for destructive-outline buttons, destructive menu items, badges, and field errors
- `--info` and `--info-foreground`: For info-colored badges, toast types, and alerts
- `--success` and `--success-foreground`: For success-colored badges, toast types, and alerts
- `--warning` and `--warning-foreground`: For warning-colored badges, toast types, and alerts

**Important**: If you manually import components, you must also import these additional tokens in your CSS file. If you use the CLI, these tokens are automatically configured for you.

## Migration from Radix UI

For developers migrating from **Radix UI**, many of our UI primitives include instructions and examples for translating equivalent Radix components to Base UI. This ensures a smooth transition while preserving accessibility, behaviors, and API patterns.
