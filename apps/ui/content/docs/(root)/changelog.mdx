## July 2025 - Complete Site Overhaul

**We've completely rebuilt Cnippet UI from the ground up.** This month brings our biggest changes yet, with a complete site overhaul and major architectural decisions that make the library faster, cleaner, and more maintainable.

### Migration to Fumadocs

We've migrated our entire documentation system to **Fumadocs**, inspired by the exceptional work done by shadcn/ui's documentation approach.

**Why Fumadocs:**
- **Better developer experience** - Cleaner, more intuitive navigation
- **Improved performance** - Faster page loads and better SEO
- **Enhanced readability** - Better typography and layout for documentation
- **Modern architecture** - Built for scalability and maintainability

The new documentation system provides a much better experience for exploring components, understanding implementation, and getting started quickly.

### TypeScript-Only Decision

We've made the strategic decision to **discontinue JavaScript support** and focus exclusively on TypeScript. This change brings significant benefits:

**Performance improvements:**
- **Cleaner codebase** - Removing dual JS/TS maintenance overhead
- **Better performance** - Optimized build processes and smaller bundles
- **Improved readability** - Especially beneficial for MDX files and documentation

**Developer benefits:**
- **Type safety** - Catch errors at development time, not runtime
- **Better IntelliSense** - Superior autocomplete and documentation in editors
- **Modern development** - Aligned with current React ecosystem standards
- **Simplified maintenance** - Single codebase to maintain and optimize

### Complete Site Redesign

The entire site has been rebuilt from the ground up with a focus on clarity, performance, and developer experience:

- **Modern navigation system** - Inspired by shadcn/ui's exceptional UX patterns with improved discoverability
- **Enhanced component showcase** - Live previews, code examples, and one-click copy functionality
- **Responsive mobile experience** - Fully optimized for all screen sizes and devices
- **Lightning-fast loading times** - Optimized assets, improved architecture, and efficient code splitting
- **Dark mode perfected** - Seamless theme switching with persistent user preferences
- **Search functionality** - Powerful search to quickly find components and documentation

### MDX Optimization

With the TypeScript-only approach, our MDX files are now:

- **More performant** - Faster compilation and rendering
- **Easier to read** - Cleaner syntax without JS/TS dual support
- **Better maintained** - Single source of truth for all examples
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript benefits in documentation examples

### Breaking Changes

**Important:** This update includes breaking changes:

- **JavaScript support removed** - All components now require TypeScript
- **Updated installation process** - Simplified setup focused on TypeScript projects
- **New documentation structure** - Migration from old docs required

### Migration Guide

For existing users upgrading to the new version:

1. **Convert to TypeScript** - Migrate your project to TypeScript (if not already using it)
   - Follow the [official TypeScript migration guide](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/migrating-from-javascript.html)
   - Update `tsconfig.json` with recommended settings

2. **Update imports** - Adopt the new TypeScript-specific import patterns
   - Replace old import paths with new component locations
   - Leverage TypeScript types for better development experience

3. **Review documentation** - Explore the new Fumadocs-powered documentation site
   - Familiarize yourself with the improved navigation and structure
   - Check component API changes and new features

4. **Update dependencies** - Ensure compatibility with the new architecture
   - Update React and TypeScript to minimum required versions
   - Review and update Tailwind CSS configuration if needed

5. **Test thoroughly** - Validate your application after migration
