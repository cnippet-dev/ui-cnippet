## February 2026 — Ecosystem Documentation

Published the CNIPPET ecosystem product documentation covering architecture, roadmap, and development strategy across all four surfaces (ui, blocks, next, learn).

## July 2025 — Complete Site Overhaul

**Rebuilt cnippet ui from the ground up.** Our biggest release yet, with a complete site redesign and major architectural changes.

### Migration to Fumadocs

Migrated the entire documentation system to **Fumadocs** for a better developer experience:

- Cleaner, more intuitive navigation
- Faster page loads and better SEO
- Improved typography and layout
- Built for scalability and maintainability

### TypeScript-Only

We discontinued JavaScript support to focus exclusively on TypeScript:

- **Cleaner codebase** — removed dual JS/TS maintenance overhead
- **Better IntelliSense** — superior autocomplete in editors
- **Type safety** — catch errors at development time, not runtime
- **Simplified maintenance** — single codebase to maintain

### Complete Site Redesign

- Modern navigation inspired by shadcn/ui's UX patterns
- Live previews, code examples, and one-click copy
- Fully responsive mobile experience
- Dark mode with persistent user preferences
- Search functionality for components and documentation

### Breaking Changes

- **JavaScript support removed** — all components now require TypeScript
- **Updated installation process** — simplified setup for TypeScript projects
- **New documentation structure** — migration from old docs required

### Migration Guide

1. **Convert to TypeScript** if not already using it
2. **Update imports** to the new component locations
3. **Review documentation** on the new Fumadocs-powered site
4. **Update dependencies** to minimum required versions
5. **Test thoroughly** — run `tsc --noEmit` and verify all components
