Forms are tricky. They are one of the most common things you'll build in a web application, but also one of the most complex.

Well-designed HTML forms are:

- Well-structured and semantically correct.
- Easy to use and navigate (keyboard).
- Accessible with ARIA attributes and proper labels.
- Has support for client and server side validation.
- Well-styled and consistent with the rest of the application.

In this guide, we will take a look at building forms with react-hook-form and zod. We're going to use a `<FormField>` component to compose accessible forms using Radix UI components.

## Anatomy

```tsx
<Form>
  <FormField
    control={...}
    name="..."
    render={() => (
      <FormItem>
        <FormLabel />
        <FormControl>
          { /* Your form field */}
        </FormControl>
        <FormDescription />
        <FormMessage />
      </FormItem>
    )}
  />
</Form>
```

## Example

```tsx
const form = useForm()

<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="username"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Username</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <Input placeholder="shadcn" {...field} />
      </FormControl>
      <FormDescription>This is your public display name.</FormDescription>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```
